#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) Linear time O(n) because the function grows as the input increases n times


b) Cuadratic time O(n^2) because its performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.  


c) Linear time O(n)  because its performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
